This is a Legend of Zelda themed Pacman game that I made in a day for one of my classes in 3rd year. The requirement of the assignment was that it had to be created in Java and that it had to be a pacman game. I kind of went a little above and beyond and included animations, music and sound effects. There was a little bug with the sound effects and sometimes the game stops playing sounds all together.

src - Contains all of the code used to render and run the game.
resources - Contains all data (images, sounds, maps) used to run the game.
docs - Contains the Javadocs explaining the purpose of all the classes and how they interact with each other.

For more info and instructions on how to build/run the game, read through the contents of INFO.pdf.
