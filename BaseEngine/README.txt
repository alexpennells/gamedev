A simple JavaScript/HTML game engine using the canvas for drawing and an inheritance style model for class creation. I originally was planning on using this for a tutorial on JS/HTML I was running, but decided not to use it as it got too extensive and became to large to teach in a learning session. Can be used in whichever way you want, so feel free to steal.
